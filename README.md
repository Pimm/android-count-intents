android.intent.action.COUNTDOWN and android.intent.action.COUNTUP
=====================

We develop apps to make phones, tablets and other devices around the world more useful. Useful devices equal happy people. If
our apps seamlessly work together, the devices become even more useful. More useful, happier people. **Love everywhere!** This
is where [Android's intents come in](http://android-developers.blogspot.nl/2012/02/share-with-intents.html).

This repository is devoted to two – timing-related – intents:

    android.intent.action.COUNTDOWN

and

    android.intent.action.COUNTUP
