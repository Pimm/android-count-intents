action.COUNTDOWN and action.COUNTUP
===================================

We all create apps to make phones, tablets and other devices around the world more useful. Useful devices equal happy people.
If apps seamlessly work together, the devices become even more useful. More useful, **happier people**.  
This is where [Android's implicit intents come in](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/02/share-with-intents.html).

This repository is devoted to two – timing-related – intent actions:

    android.intent.action.COUNTDOWN

and

    android.intent.action.COUNTUP

Both intent actions are designed to display a timer app. The intent actions are *neutral* and *open*. You are encouraged to
[use them](//github.com/Pimm/android-count-intents/blob/master/documentation/using.md) and even
[support them](//github.com/Pimm/android-count-intents/blob/master/documentation/supporting.md) in your own projects, where
appropriate.
